# R68-sounds

An R68 sound pack for BVE. Developed primarily for BVE5, but with a few edits should work on OpenBVE as well. (I have not tested porting to OpenBVE.)

The master branch is constantly in development. Check releases for (much smaller) packs that you can efficiently incorporate into your train.
